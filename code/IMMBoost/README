## This dir contains IMMBoost code that can be used in a single processor computer.

## Todo:
1. Go through the 'svm.v5.wrap.pl' and comment on each step as well as the scripts
2. Modify each script to:
    1) remove the use of slave node dir
    2) remove dependency in '/shared-mounts/sinhas/lib/'
    3) check the exist of BioPerl
    4) change IMM and SVM path to relative path
    5) change script name to Camel style
    6) use 10% of the seq data and only 3 CRM sets as example data for the pipeline
